# Leash: Visibility for the AI Agent Era

*Published: February 19, 2026*

---

I've spent five years in endpoint security. Managing CrowdStrike deployments across thousands of endpoints. Watching threats, responding to incidents, building detection rules.

When AI coding agents started running on my machine — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor — I realized something uncomfortable:

**I had zero visibility into what they were actually doing.**

They had access to my files. My terminal. My credentials. And I had no tooling to see what they touched.

## The Problem

AI agents are incredible productivity tools. They write code, refactor monoliths, debug complex issues. But they run with real permissions on real machines.

The current landscape:

- **Enterprise EDR** (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) — great for traditional threats, doesn't understand AI agent process patterns
- **LLM Guardrails** (Lakera, Langfuse) — monitor API inputs/outputs, blind to OS-level activity
- **Nothing** — for what AI agents actually do at the system level

So I built Leash.

## What Leash Does

Leash is an open-source AI agent visibility tool. It watches what AI agents do on your machine:

- **Process Trees** — Track every process an agent spawns, and what those children spawn
- **File Access** — Cryptographic (blake3) monitoring of sensitive files
- **Network Egress** — Per-process outbound connections
- **Credential Access** — Alerts when agents touch SSH keys, configs, secrets
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** — Every detection tagged with relevant techniques

All in real-time. All observable. All logged.

---

## The Philosophy

Leash is **observation-first**. Response actions (like SIGSTOP) exist but are opt-in and disabled by default.

Why? Because visibility is more valuable than automated blocking. You should know what's happening before you decide what to do about it.

This also means Leash is safe to run. It watches. It reports. It doesn't interfere unless you explicitly tell it to.

## Technical Architecture

Leash is written in Rust for safety and performance:

- **Async event bus** on Tokio for non-blocking detection
- **Single binary** — 5.9MB, no runtime dependencies
- **Multiple alerting channels** — Slack, Discord, Telegram, JSON log
- **Plugin architecture** — easy to add new alert integrations

v0.1 uses `/proc` polling. v0.2 will use eBPF via the `aya` crate for kernel-level, zero-overhead monitoring.

## MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

Leash maps detections to both traditional ATT&CK and the new [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) techniques specifically for AI systems:

| Detection | Technique | ID |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Agent spawns shell | Command & Scripting Interpreter | T1059.004 |
| Credential file access | Credentials in Files | T1552.001 |
| SSH key access | Unsecured Credentials | T1552.004 |
| Cron modification | Scheduled Task/Job | T1053.003 |
| Sensitive file read | Data from Local System | T1005 |
| Outbound connection | Exfiltration Over C2 | T1041 |
| LLM prompt patterns | ATLAS: Prompt Injection | AML.T0054 |

---

## What's Next

v0.2 will bring:

- **eBPF kernel hooks** — zero-overhead monitoring via `aya`
- **Anti-tamper watchdog** — mutual process monitoring to prevent bypass
- **macOS support** — expanding beyond Linux
- **Web dashboard** — historical analysis and visualization

---

## Try It Out

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meridianhouse/leash.git
cd leash
cargo build --release
./target/release/leash init
./target/release/leash watch
```

Or install from source and start watching in under a minute.

**Leash** — Put your AI on a short leash.

Built by someone who got tired of not knowing what their AI agents were doing.
