replace with proper error handling\n- Remove dead code warnings\n\nTASK 2: Add comprehensive integration tests\nIn tests/integration.rs, add:\n- Test leash init creates config file\n- Test leash test generates exactly 4 events (one per severity)\n- Test leash scan --json produces valid JSON array\n- Test leash history --json with empty DB returns empty array\n- Test leash export --format csv produces valid CSV header\n- Test leash --version outputs version string\n- Test leash watch --json exits cleanly on SIGTERM\n- Test invalid config file produces helpful error message\n- Test

proptest or quickcheck dependency:\n- Property: scrub_secrets never increases string length\n- Property: escape_html output never contains raw < > &\n- Property: any valid YAML config parses without

handling\n- Remove dead code warnings\n\nTASK 2: Add comprehensive integration tests\nIn tests/integration.rs, add:\n- Test leash init creates config file\n- Test leash test generates exactly 4 events (one per severity)\n- Test leash scan --json produces valid JSON array\n- Test leash history --json with empty DB returns empty array\n- Test leash export --format csv produces valid CSV header\n- Test leash --version outputs version string\n- Test leash watch --json exits cleanly on SIGTERM\n- Test invalid config file produces helpful error message\n- Test allowlist exact matching (process \"code\" should NOT match \"codex\")\n- Test secrets scrubbing (API keys redacted in output)\nTarget: 60+ total tests\n\nTASK 3: Add property-based tests\nAdd proptest or quickcheck dependency:\n-
